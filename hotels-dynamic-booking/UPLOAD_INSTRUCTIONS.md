# 🚀 Upload Instructions for shorttrips.eu

## ✅ Files Ready for Upload

Your ShortTrips application is ready for deployment! Here are the exact files you need to upload to your Strato server:

### 📁 Files to Upload (from `dist/` folder):

```
📦 Upload these files to your Strato web root directory:

├── index.html                    ← Main HTML file
├── placeholder.svg              ← Favicon
├── robots.txt                   ← SEO file
└── assets/
    ├── index-BuMGGAWA.css      ← Compiled CSS
    └── index-DQHvzHM5.js       ← Compiled JavaScript
```

## 🌐 Strato Upload Steps

### Step 1: Access Strato Control Panel
1. Go to https://www.strato.de and log in
2. Navigate to "Websites & Domains" or "Webhosting"
3. Find your domain `shorttrips.eu`
4. Click on "File Manager" or "FTP Access"

### Step 2: Navigate to Web Directory
- Look for `htdocs` or `public_html` folder
- This is where your website files should go
- **Important**: Upload files to the ROOT of this directory (not in a subfolder)

### Step 3: Upload Files
1. **Delete any existing files** in the web directory (if this is a fresh setup)
2. Upload all files from the `dist/` folder:
   - `index.html` → root directory
   - `placeholder.svg` → root directory  
   - `robots.txt` → root directory
   - `assets/` folder → root directory (with both CSS and JS files inside)

### Step 4: Verify Upload
After uploading, your directory structure should look like:
```
htdocs/ (or public_html/)
├── index.html
├── placeholder.svg
├── robots.txt
└── assets/
    ├── index-BuMGGAWA.css
    └── index-DQHvzHM5.js
```

## 🔧 Post-Upload Configuration

### 1. Test Your Site
- Visit: https://shorttrips.eu
- Check that the page loads correctly
- Look for the "ShortTrips" branding
- Test the search functionality

### 2. Check API Status
- Look for the API status banner at the top
- Should show "SunHotels API Connected" (or error if API is down)
- Payment status should show "Disabled (Test Mode)"

### 3. Verify Functionality
- ✅ Page loads without errors
- ✅ Search bar is visible and functional
- ✅ Hotel cards display (mock data)
- ✅ Responsive design works on mobile
- ✅ No console errors in browser

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Site Doesn't Load:
1. **Check file structure** - ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
2. **Check file permissions** - files should be readable (644)
3. **Check Strato logs** - look for any server errors
4. **Clear browser cache** - try incognito/private mode

### If API Shows Errors:
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify CORS** - SunHotels API might have CORS restrictions
3. **Test API directly** - check if SunHotels API is accessible

### If Styling is Broken:
1. **Check CSS file** - ensure `index-BuMGGAWA.css` uploaded correctly
2. **Check file paths** - ensure assets folder is in the right place
3. **Clear browser cache** - force refresh with Ctrl+F5
